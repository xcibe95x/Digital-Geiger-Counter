# DIY Geiger Counter
 Code for my Diy Geiger Counter.
 
 DISCLAIMER* Don't take any of my informations for granted, i'm figuring out how to make this do a good job, but this is no professional stuff and i'm not expert in the matter. At the end, we should be able to enjoy a DIY Geiger Counter that give's approximated readings to give an idea of what is radioactive or not.
 
 "Gonna keep on studying on the subject and upgrading the code accordingly.
What i want to achieve is CPM and uSv/hr , mr/hr, as now the code does not calculate proper CPM or mr/hr."
 
 
 The Geiger counter is still in progress at the moment since i'm changing the tube, since i bought one that is too much insensitive and i had no clue if the transistor circuit works correctly atm.
 
 But optmizing the code already and fixing some bugs.
 
 Photos and Schematics will be added in future. Original concept is from another youtuber, i'm just readapting the script, translating and adding more indications.
 I will try to calibrate the counter for a certain tube and add indications how to calibrate yours with different tubes, will try to add the math required as simple as possible
 and add microsivert switch with a button. My project has 3 buttons and 1 led. (Avoid connecting the pin to D13 of your arduino nano if you are using SPI)
